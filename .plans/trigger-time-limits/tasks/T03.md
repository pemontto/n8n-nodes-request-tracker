# T03: Add "New Ticket by ID" trigger mode

**Status**: 🟡 **Planned**
**Effort**: Medium
**Blocked By**: None

---

## Goal
Add a trigger mode that tracks the highest ticket ID seen and only triggers when new higher IDs appear.

## Context
For users who just want to catch new tickets (not updates), tracking by ID is simpler and more reliable than timestamp-based detection. No query needed - just watch for `id > lastSeenId`.

## Requirements
- Add trigger mode selector: "New/Updated Tickets (Query)" vs "New Tickets (by ID)"
- In ID mode:
  - Query: `id > ${lastSeenId}` (plus any queue filter?)
  - Store `lastSeenId` in static data
  - On first run, get current max ID and store it (don't trigger)
  - Subsequent runs trigger on any ticket with higher ID
- Consider: should user be able to filter by queue in ID mode?

## Open Questions
- Should ID mode allow queue filtering? (e.g., "New tickets in queue X")
- What fields to return for new tickets in ID mode?
- Should ID mode respect the time backstop from T02?

## Action Items
- [ ] Add trigger mode selector parameter
- [ ] Implement ID-based query logic
- [ ] Store/retrieve lastSeenId in static data
- [ ] Handle first-run initialization (no trigger, just store max ID)
- [ ] Add queue filter option for ID mode (optional)
- [ ] Update node description for new mode
