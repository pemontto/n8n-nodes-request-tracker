# T01: Update TicketSQL description with time constraint guidance

**Status**: ✅ **Completed**
**Effort**: Small
**Blocked By**: None

---

## Goal
Improve the `ticketSql` parameter description to warn users about adding time constraints to avoid performance issues.

## Context
Users entering TicketSQL queries without time filters could match millions of tickets. While results are limited (10 in manual mode, 50-100 in polling), the query itself can be slow. This change educates users on best practices.

## Requirements
- Update `ticketSql` description in `RequestTrackerTrigger.node.ts`
- Include warning about unbounded queries
- Add example with time constraint

## Action Items
- [x] Update `ticketSql` description text
- [x] Add example showing `Created > 'YYYY-MM-DD'` pattern
- [x] Build and verify description renders correctly

## Execution Summary
**Completed**: 2026-01-15

**What was implemented**:
- Updated description to include tip about time constraints
- Added example: `Queue = 'General' AND Status = 'open' AND Created > '2024-01-01'`

**Challenges encountered**:
- None
