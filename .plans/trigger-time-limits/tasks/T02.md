# T02: Add time backstop to all trigger modes

**Status**: 🟡 **Planned**
**Effort**: Medium
**Blocked By**: None

---

## Goal
Inject a time constraint into all queries to prevent unbounded lookback. Minimum = poll interval.

## Context
Users may write queries without time filters. Even with result limits, the query itself can be slow on large RT instances. A backstop ensures queries only look at recent data.

## Requirements
- In polling mode: inject `${triggerOnField} > ${now - backstopDuration}`
- In manual mode: same backstop applies
- Backstop = max(poll interval, configurable default like 24h)
- User can override with larger value if needed

## Open Questions
- How to get poll interval from n8n? (may need to use workflow settings)
- Should backstop be configurable in node options?
- What's the default backstop duration? (24h? 1h?)

## Action Items
- [ ] Research how to access poll interval in IPollFunctions
- [ ] Add backstop duration option (or use sensible default)
- [ ] Modify query construction to inject time constraint
- [ ] Update description to explain backstop behavior
- [ ] Test with different poll frequencies
